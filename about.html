          <p>Hi! I'm Amanda. Welcome to the farm!</p> 
          <p>Have you ever been walking in the woods, when the air is still, and noticed a single fern dancing and swaying all on its own, as if being moved by a secret breeze? That, my friend, is a dancing fern and the namesake of our farm. It's an unexpected and delightful thing--and exactly the vibe we're going for around here!</p> 
          <p>Dancing Fern Farm is located in Marquette County in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We specialize in practical products made with just the right amount of whimsy. Our farm seasonally produces eggs, herbs, florals and floral producs, along with some baked items and handmade goods.</p>

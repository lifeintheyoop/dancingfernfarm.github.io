          <h1>January 7, 2026</h1>
<p>It’s January and it feels good to be through the Christmas season and moving into the new year. The ground is frozen and buried under (literally) two feet of snow, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t work to be done. Sitting down to scratch out yet another list, I remind myself: Thinking about farming still counts as farming. I’m not wasting time “doing nothing”. Sometimes the work is dirty and sweaty; sometimes it looks a lot like daydreaming.</p> 
<p>So what’s filling these daydreams? Flowers. Lots and lots of flowers.</p>
<p>Though I can’t start putting seeds in the ground too early, I can certainly get them picked out and ordered, which I've done this week. This year, I'm focusing on blooms that can pull double-duty in both fresh and dried arrangements, including some whimsical touches for our holiday goods–I’m looking at you, dusty miller!</p>
<p>Other projects that have received attention this month have been the website (which is starting to actually look legit), an upgraded and freshly-painted door to my potting shed (AKA my Sanctuary), and planning out the seasonal treats to put in the farmstand.</p>
<p>Wait. Farmstand?!? YES!! FARMSTAND!! If all goes as planned, we’ll be opening the Dancing Fern Farmstand/treat shack/mini-boutique to bring a little joy and convenience to the neighborhood. Hopefully. We have a lot of work to do before that happens, but we’re working on it and will keep ya posted. I’m keeping my fingers realistically crossed for a late summer or fall opening.</p>
<p>Here’s to planning for the new year, getting excited about new flowers, and growing big ideas!</p>
<p>Farm on, 
<br>Amanda</br>

          <h1>February 1, 2026</h1>
<p>February 1st marks the midway point between the Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox and, wow, I’m ready to be closer to spring. January was cold. Like, more than 20 degrees below zero cold, without the windchill. There was an entire week I was in full-on, farmgirl battle mode against freezing pipes and freezing livestock, but we made it. No one froze, the pipes didn't burst, and we’re all (very) happy the cold snap has passed.</p> 

<p>I know I said it was too early to start any seeds, but I couldn’t wait any longer. Rosemary wins the prize for “First in the Dirt” for 2026. During the last week of January, I opened a fresh bag of Vermont Compost, shaped my first little soil blocks of the season, and pressed the tiny seeds into the soil. So it begins. </p> 
            
<p>We're looking forward to Valentine’s Day! This day is a special day for us. It marks the 1 year anniversary of adding our cowgirl corgi to the pack. We adopted Val (short for Valentine) from our local animal shelter, UPAWS, and she’s been a great addition to the family. She’s a down and dirty farmdog with a silly personality and a bit of sass (ok, maybe a lot of sass). This Valentine’s Day, in honor of her adoption, we’ll be making some special VALentine’s treats that I’ll post on the <a href="shop.html">Shop</a> page.</p>

<p>Farm on, 
<br>Amanda</br>
